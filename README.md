# Terrestrial-Aerial-Navigation

**Terrestrial-Aerial-Navigation** is an autonomous navigation framework that brings complete autonomy to terrestrial-aerial bimodal vehicles (TABVs). This repository contains the following sub-modules:

- A bi-level motion planner which generates safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible terrestrial-aerial hybrid trajectories.
- A customized [TABV platform](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/TABV-Platform) that carries adequate sensing and computing resources while ensuring portability and
  maneuverability.

# Quick Start
Compiling tests passed on ubuntu 20.04. You can just execute the following commands one by one.

1. Install nlopt following the [official document](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Installation/).

2. Install other dependencies and compile the project.
```
sudo apt-get install libarmadillo-dev
git clone https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Terrestrial-Aerial-Navigation.git
cd Terrestrial-Aerial-Navigation
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
sh src/run.sh
```
Then, you can trigger the planner and choose the planning goal using the ```2D Nav Goal``` tool in ```rviz```. Then, the TABV will follow terrestrial-aerial hybrid trajectories to navigate a  random forest map and cross a high barrier :

</p>

[NOTE] remember to change the CUDA option of **src/uav_simulator/local_sensing/CMakeLists.txt**, i.e., change the 'arch' and 'code' flags in the line of 

    set(CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS 
      -gencode arch=compute_75,code=sm_75;
    ) 

according to your Nvidia graphics card version. You can check the right code [here](https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/).

We build on [Fast-Planner](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/Fast-Planner) by extending its path searching and trajectory generation methods to TABV motion planning. We use  [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  for solving nonlinear optimization problems in trajectory generation.
